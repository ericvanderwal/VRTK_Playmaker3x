# VRTK Playmaker Action Set

These c# files are created to be used in conjunction with the Unity3d asset Playmaker, along with the VRTK (virtual reality tool kit). They act as bridge to allow VRTK variables to be changed and various methods and events to be called from within Playmaker during Unity3d runtime.

The following project is released under the MIT license as stated below. 

## Important - Read First

The current master version to be used together with the current VRTK Github version (3.3.0 beta). **Always backup your projects before updating **   

Tested and working with the most current version of Playmaker from the asset store, as well as the most current version of steam VR from the asset store.

## Updating

If you are updating from 3.2.0 or 3.1.0, to 3.3.0, make sure to backup your project first. Then remove all the VRTK playmaker actions and replace the folder entirely. The 3.3.0 does include legacy actions from 3.2.0/3.1.0 that are no longer in use. I am currently in the process of marking them all obsolete (as I find them). They will not break your project, but they rely on script that are no longer in use for VRTK. They are included however to not break any updates.

Once finished updating, you may need open some actions in your FSM to correct them. Some actions have new variable fields added or removed. This was unavoidable as VRTK continues to update.

Specifically these actions:

getControllerVisible  
setControllerOpacity  
toggleControllerVisbility  
getControllerVelocity  
GetGrabPressed  
GetGripPressed  
GetMenuPressed (aka, button two).  
GetUiClickPressed  
GetPointerPressed  
GetUsePressed  
SetBodyPhysicsSnapToFloorSettings  
SetDashTeleportHeightAdjustOptions  
pointerDestinationInfoExit  
pointerDestinationInfo  
AltSetPointerDestinationMarkerSettings
